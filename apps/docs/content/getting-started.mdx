# Getting Started

Rigour is designed to be zero-config. You can be up and running in less than a minute.

## Installation

You can use Rigour via `npx` (recommended for zero-clutter) or install it globally.

### Using npx
```bash
npx @rigour-labs/cli init
```

### Global Install
```bash
npm install -g @rigour-labs/cli
```

## Initialization

Run `init` in your project root. Rigour will analyze your files and suggest a configuration.

```bash
rigour init
```

By default, this will:
1. Create a `rigour.yml` configuration file.
2. Create `docs/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (the "Handshake" for AI agents).
3. Create `.cursor/rules/rigour.mdc` (if you are using Cursor).

## Running Checks

To verify your project:

```bash
rigour check
```

## The Self-Healing Loop

The true power of Rigour is its ability to guide AI agents to fix their own mistakes.

```bash
rigour run -- <your-agent-command> "fix standard violations"
```

Example with Claude:
```bash
rigour run -- npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code "apply architectural fixes"
```
