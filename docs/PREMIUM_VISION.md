# 💎 Rigour Premium: The Road to $1M ARR

Rigour moves from a "CLI Utility" to a "Strategic Asset" by solving the **Consistency Problem** in large-scale AI engineering teams.

## 🚀 Strategic Expansion

### 1. VS Code Extension (High Priority)
- **Opinion**: **YES.** Developers live in the IDE.
- **Value**: Instant feedback. Developers see "Architectural Violation" squigglies while typing.
- **Implementation**: LSP (Language Server Protocol) wrapper around `@rigour-labs/core`.
- **Monetization**: "Team Workspace" syncing. Change a rule in the cloud, and every IDE in the team updates instantly.

### 2. Chrome Extension (Low Priority)
- **Opinion**: **Skip for now.** 
- **Rationale**: Chrome extensions are harder to monetize for devtools. PR inspection is better handled by **GitHub Checks** (which we already support via `--ci`).
- **Niche use**: Real-time audit of code in web-based agents (e.g., v0.dev, Replit), but IDE/CI remains the "Golden Path".

### 3. Presence: `rigour.io`
- **Opinion**: **Register immediately.**
- **Rationale**: `rigour.io` is professional, short, and carries significant brand authority in the "Security/Quality" space. It beats `.net` or `.builders` for a flagship SaaS.
