# 🛡️ Rigour

**The Quality Gate Loop for AI-Assisted Engineering.**

Rigour is an automated quality enforcement engine designed to keep AI agents (and humans) within the guardrails of high-quality software engineering.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize Rigour in your project
npx @rigour-labs/cli init

# Run your agent inside a quality loop
npx @rigour-labs/cli run -- claude "Refactor the auth service"
```

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Zero-Config Discovery**: Automatically detects project role (AI, UI, Data) and paradigm.
- **AST-Based Gates**: Deep structural analysis of your code (Complexity, SOLID, Signatures).
- **Self-Healing Loop**: Provides high-fidelity feedback (Fix Packets) to AI agents for automated correction.
- **Strategic Guardians**: Enforces architectural boundaries and dependency standards.

## 🏁 The Rigour Loop

1. **Check**: Verify compliance with project standards.
2. **Analyze**: Identify violations and generate structured diagnostics.
3. **Refactor**: AI agents apply fixes based on specific instructions.
4. **Repeat**: Loop until the quality gates return **PASS**.
